# SOS-TS-GraphDrawing

Graph-drawing software utilizes procedures to position nodes and arcs to produce graphs representations with desired properties. The literature contains many different standards to represent a graph (Di Battista et al., 1998). All of them have readability as the main objective, although there are different ways to achieve this goal.  Research studies of graph drawing have produced a prolific range of applications, from trees to orthogonal graphs. In this paper, we focus on the realm of graph drawing called hierarchical representations.

General graphs can be drawn as hierarchical maps following Sugiyama's framework, which obtains a good drawing by representing the arcs according to certain aesthetics that induce readability: straight lines, uniform direction, and low number of crossings (Sugiyama et al., 1981).
